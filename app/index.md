## A

### Accreditation

All initial teacher training providers must be ‘accredited’ by the Secretary of State for Education. This process of ‘accreditation’ confirms they have permission to offer courses leading to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). (NB: Ofsted is the body which checks the courses providers offer meet the standards set by the department.)

The exception is the School Direct (SD) training route; SDs need a ‘ratifying accredited provider’. The ratifying accredited provider may be a School Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT) or a Higher Education Institute (HEI), and is responsible for maintaining the quality of the training provided.

As accredited bodies, SCITTs can offer QTS courses but do not have the power to award a degree. To enable candidates who seek an academic award like a PGCE (Post Graduate Certificate in Education) they need to partner with an HEI.

The relationship between accredited training providers and the institutions they ratify is complex. For example, we know that individual courses can be ratified by different accredited bodies (so a School Direct may work with both an HEI and more than one SCITT to ratify its courses).

### Allocation

Permission to run limited courses.

### Ancient languages

Used to describe teaching the study of languages no longer in widespread spoken usage, such as Latin or Ancient Greek. Prefer using the specific languages studied where possible.

## B

### Becoming a teacher (BAT)

An internal term used to describe all of the services related to the journey to become a teacher (sometimes referred to as a ‘service line’).

### Bursaries AND Scholarships

These are sums of money available to trainees on (fee-based) courses in certain subjects. They’re tax-free, and awarded by DfE, in some cases in partnership with professional bodies. The main difference between bursaries and scholarships is that the value of scholarships is a little higher, and you’ll generally need a 2:1 to qualify for one (you’ll only need a 2:2 to get a bursary). You also have to apply for a scholarship, whereas you’ll automatically receive a bursary once you start training (if you meet the criteria). You can only claim one of them - not both.

## C

### Course

A training programme providers create for candidates to apply to.

### Course Code

A code used to identify courses (unique to a provider).

### Cycle

The period during which initial teacher training (ITT) applications are open, usually beginning in October and ending in September.

## D

### Database of Qualified Teachers (DQT)

### Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check

A service from the Disclosure and Barring Service which checks for any potential criminal record. There are four levels, ‘basic’, ‘standard’, ‘enhanced’ and ‘enhanced with barred lists’. Applying for teacher training requires the enhanced check. Generally, the acronym does not need to be spelled out, but the check should be described, for example as a criminal record check. See [DBS checks](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about#dbs-checks).

### Database of trainee teachers and providers (DTTP)

[Database of trainee teachers and providers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/database-of-trainee-teachers-and-providers-dttp).

## E

### Early career payments

These apply to chemistry, languages, maths and physics. They’re sums of money you get after you’ve qualified as a teacher - they’re paid out in your second, third and fourth year of teaching. You get £2k each year - £3k in some parts of the country.

### English as a foreign language

Used to describe the use of English by people whose first language or languages are not English. The teaching of this is a specialism sometimes described as ‘teaching English as a foreign language’ (TEFL). The use of English as a foreign language can be assessed through formal assessments such the ‘International English Language Testing System’ (IELTS) and ‘Test of English as a Foreign Language’ (TOEFL).

### Early years initial teacher training (EYITT)

The equivalent to initial teacher training (ITT) but specifically for teaching 0 to 5 year olds.

## F

### Fitness to teach check

This is not a specific check, but a general description of assessments of a person’s health and physical and mental capacity to teach. Each provider may use different processes or services for these checks, which are usually a condition of offers on teacher training courses.

## G

### Get information about schools (GIAS)

This is a [register of schools and colleges in England](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/).

## H

### High potential initial teacher training (HPITT)

This is a two year postgraduate initial teacher training route where graduates are paid a salary. The scheme is run by [Teach First](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/training-programme), a registered salary, and is more publicly known by the name ‘teach first’.

### Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA)

The [Higher Education Statistics Agency](https://www.hesa.ac.uk) is the official agency for the collection, analysis and dissemination of quantitative information about higher education in the United Kingdom.

### Higher education institution (HEI)

Usually a university. A generic term for organisations that teach at degree level or higher (’higher education’). Some still call themselves colleges or use another term.

## I

### International qualified teacher status (iQTS)

A UK teaching qualification where applicants study and train outside of the UK, and leads to the automatic award of qualified teacher status (QTS). See [Introducing international qualified teacher status (iQTS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-qualified-teacher-status-iqts/introducing-the-international-qualified-teacher-status-iqts-pilot).

## K

### Keeping children safe in education (KCSIE)

Statutory guidance for schools and colleges on safeguarding children and safer recruitment. See [Keeping children safe in education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2).

## L

### Lead school

Within initial teacher training (ITT), this refers to the main organisation in a School Direct partnership. It can be a maintained school, academy, head office, sixth form college, pupil referral unit, or free school. It partners with other schools and accredited bodies to deliver teacher training courses. It has overall responsibility for making sure that School Direct criteria are upheld, and for requesting training places from DfE. Places are allocated directly to the lead school. A ’good’ or ’outstanding’ Ofsted rating is a requirement for lead schools.

## M

### Marketing name

The commonly used name of an educational organisation. This may not be the legal name.

### Modern languages

This term is sometimes used to differentiate the teaching of languages in everyday use from ‘ancient languages’ such as Latin and Ancient Greek which are no longer widely spoken. It also typically does not include teaching English. Prefer listing the specific languages where possible.


## N

### National Association of School-Based Teacher Trainers (NASBTT)

The [National Association of School-Based Teacher Trainers](https://www.nasbtt.org.uk) is a registered charity which represents the interests of schools-led teacher training provision in relation to the development and implementation of national policy developments. They are the largest representative body of SCITTs and School Directs.

## O

### Organisation

A generic term used broadly to encompass the different types of entity involving in teacher training (schools, universities, School Directs, etc). Use a more specific term where appropriate.

## P

### Postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE)

This is a teaching qualification that - when it’s paired with QTS (qualified teacher status) - allows you to teach in state schools in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It’s also recognised internationally (which is the major advantage of having it, over just QTS). PGCE without QTS qualifies you to teach further education, but not primary or secondary education.

### Postgraduate diploma in education (PGDE)

Very similar to the PGCE. Generally includes more credits towards a Master’s degree.

### Postgraduate initial teacher training (PGITT)

Initial teacher training done after graduating with a degree.

### Provider led

A course that that is led by an HEI or a SCITT (the opposite of school led/based).

## Q

## R

### Rollover

Within initial teacher training, this refers to the copying over of courses from one recruitment cycle to the next. It starts in mid July and takes about a month in full. All courses are copied over; training providers can then eliminate any courses they don’t want to run, and make any other changes to ensure their course profiles are correct for the upcoming cycle.

## S

### Scholarships

See [Bursaries](#bursaries-and-scholarships).

### School centred initial teacher training (SCITT)

Within initial teacher training, School-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) is most commonly a school who have incorporated a separate legal entity (company) dedicated to delivering teacher training. SCITTs are accredited bodies.

### School direct (SD)

Within initial teacher training, these are single schools able to recruit trainees. They must partner with an accredited body.

### SITS

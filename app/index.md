## A

### Ancient languages

Used to describe teaching the study of languages no longer in widespread spoken usage, such as Latin or Ancient Greek. Prefer using the specific languages studied where possible.

## E

### English as a foreign language

Used to describe the use of English by people whose first language or languages are not English. The teaching of this is a specialism sometimes described as ‘teaching English as a foreign language’ (TEFL). The use of English as a foreign language can be assessed through formal assessments such the ‘International English Language Testing System’ (IELTS) and ‘Test of English as a Foreign Language’ (TOEFL).

### Early years initial teacher training (EYITT)

The equivalent to initial teacher training (ITT) but specifically for teaching 0 to 5 year olds.

## F

### Fitness to teach check

This is not a specific check, but a general description of assessments of a person’s health and physical and mental capacity to teach. Each provider may use different processes or services for these checks, which are usually a condition of offers on teacher training courses.


## H

### High potential initial teacher training (HPITT)

This is a two year postgraduate initial teacher training route where graduates are paid a salary. The scheme is run by [Teach First](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/training-programme), a registered salary, and is more publicly known by the name ‘teach first’.

## I

### International qualified teacher status (iQTS)

A UK teaching qualification where applicants study and train outside of the UK, and leads to the automatic award of qualified teacher status (QTS). See [Introducing international qualified teacher status (iQTS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-qualified-teacher-status-iqts/introducing-the-international-qualified-teacher-status-iqts-pilot).

## K

### Keeping children safe in education (KCSIE)

Statutory guidance for schools and colleges on safeguarding children and safer recruitment. See [Keeping children safe in education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2).

## M

### Modern languages

This term is sometimes used to differentiate the teaching of languages in everyday use from ‘ancient languages’ such as Latin and Ancient Greek which are no longer widely spoken. It also typically does not include teaching English. Prefer listing the specific languages where possible.


## P

### Postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE)

This is a teaching qualification that - when it’s paired with QTS (qualified teacher status) - allows you to teach in state schools in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It’s also recognised internationally (which is the major advantage of having it, over just QTS). PGCE without QTS qualifies you to teach further education, but not primary or secondary education.

### Postgraduate diploma in education (PGDE)

Very similar to the PGCE. Generally includes more credits towards a Master’s degree.

### Postgraduate initial teacher training (PGITT)

Initial teacher training done after graduating with a degree.
 to ensure their course profiles are correct for the upcoming cycle.

## S

### School centred initial teacher training (SCITT)

Within initial teacher training, School-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) is most commonly a school who have incorporated a separate legal entity (company) dedicated to delivering teacher training. SCITTs are accredited bodies.
